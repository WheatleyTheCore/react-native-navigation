# react-native-navigation
This is my messing around with react navigation(https://reactnavigation.org/) in order to better understand the anatomy of native applications.


AS A SIDE NOTE: cocoapods' current version does not work on macos mojave right now, version 1.8.4 does work however. Also when installing you have to tell it to use the user's local bin folder not the system's since macos doesn't like people messing with its system files. 
I'm putting that note here for future reference, but it is relavent to this project as it will not work if the above steps are not followed.
